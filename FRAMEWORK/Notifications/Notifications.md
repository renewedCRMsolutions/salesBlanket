# Notifications

should we allow a snooze on notifications?EditAdding a snooze functionality to notifications would be a useful feature that improves user experience by giving them more control over when they're notified. This is especially helpful for busy users who need to manage their attention effectively.
Here's how you could implement this in your database schema:
sqlALTER TABLE notifications
ADD COLUMN snoozed_until timestamptz,
ADD COLUMN snooze_count integer DEFAULT 0;
This simple addition would allow you to:

Track when a notification should reappear after being snoozed
Count how many times a notification has been snoozed (which could be useful for analytics or limiting excessive snoozing)

Then in your application logic, you would:

Only show notifications where either:

snoozed_until IS NULL, or
snoozed_until < current_timestamp

When a user snoozes a notification:
sqlUPDATE notifications
SET
snoozed_until = now() + interval '4 hours', -- or whatever time period
snooze_count = snooze_count + 1,
updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 'notification_uuid';

You could offer standard snooze durations like:

Snooze for 1 hour
Snooze until tomorrow
Snooze for a week
Custom duration

This approach gives users flexibility while still ensuring important notifications aren't forgotten. It's particularly valuable for approval workflows where timely action is important but users need to manage when they address these requests.RetryRWdo we need to add a display time for the notification? this way a manager could set a notification for someone in the futurewEditYes, adding a display time for notifications would be a valuable addition to your schema. This would allow managers to schedule notifications for the future, which is particularly useful for upcoming deadlines, scheduled events, or planned follow-ups.
Here's how you could modify your notifications table:
sqlALTER TABLE notifications
ADD COLUMN display_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
ADD COLUMN expires_at timestamptz;
With these additions:

display_at - Controls when the notification should first appear to the user

Default is immediate (now())
Can be set to a future date/time for scheduled notifications

expires_at - Defines when a notification is no longer relevant

Can be used to automatically clean up old notifications
Helps prevent notification overload

Then in your application logic:

Only show notifications where:

display_at <= current_timestamp AND
(expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > current_timestamp) AND
(snoozed_until IS NULL OR snoozed_until < current_timestamp)

For creating future notifications:
sqlINSERT INTO notifications (
id, notification_type_id, user_id, entity_id,
related_record_id, related_record_type, message,
is_read, display_at, expires_at, created_at
)
VALUES (
uuid_generate_v4(),
'notification_type_uuid',
'user_to_notify_uuid',
'entity_uuid',
'related_record_uuid',
'record_type',
'Your scheduled notification message',
false,
'2025-05-01 09:00:00', -- Schedule for future date
'2025-05-10 09:00:00', -- Optional expiration
now()
);

This enhancement would support multiple use cases:

Managers scheduling reminders for team members
System-generated notifications for upcoming deadlines
Timed follow-ups for incomplete tasks
Sequential notifications for multi-step processes

It's a valuable addition that makes your notification system much more powerful and flexible.RetryRWdo we need a notification_rules or settings? just to handle the thresholds?EditYes, adding notification rules or settings would be a valuable enhancement to your system. This would allow you to manage notification behavior at a more granular level, defining thresholds, frequency, and user preferences.
Here's how you could implement this:
sql-- Global notification settings
CREATE TABLE notification_settings (
id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
notification_type_id uuid NOT NULL,
name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
description text,
default_value jsonb NOT NULL,
is_user_configurable boolean DEFAULT true,
created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
FOREIGN KEY (notification_type_id) REFERENCES notification_types(id)
);

-- User-specific notification preferences
CREATE TABLE user_notification_preferences (
id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
user_id uuid NOT NULL,
notification_setting_id uuid NOT NULL,
value jsonb NOT NULL,
created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
FOREIGN KEY (notification_setting_id) REFERENCES notification_settings(id),
UNIQUE (user_id, notification_setting_id)
);

-- Notification rules for complex logic
CREATE TABLE notification_rules (
id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
description text,
entity_type_id uuid,
notification_type_id uuid NOT NULL,
conditions jsonb NOT NULL,
actions jsonb NOT NULL,
is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
priority integer DEFAULT 100,
created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
FOREIGN KEY (entity_type_id) REFERENCES entity_types(id),
FOREIGN KEY (notification_type_id) REFERENCES notification_types(id)
);
This structure provides:

Notification Settings

Global defaults for notification behavior
Settings like frequency, delivery methods, thresholds
Uses JSONB for flexible configuration options

User Preferences

User-specific overrides of global settings
Allows users to customize their notification experience
Maintains the same structure as global settings for consistency

Notification Rules

Rule-based notification generation and delivery
Supports complex conditions (e.g., "Notify if task overdue > 3 days")
Actions defining what happens when conditions are met
Priority to handle rule conflicts

Example settings might include:

Notification frequency thresholds
Delivery methods (in-app, email, SMS)
Batching preferences
Quiet hours
Department-specific rules
