We've set up a comprehensive foundation for the SalesBlanket v4 project. Here's what we've accomplished:

  1. Server Architecture:
    - Apollo Server with Express for GraphQL API
    - TypeScript configuration
    - Modular code structure
    - Database connection setup
    - Authentication system with JWT
  2. GraphQL Schema:
    - Schema structure broken into modular files
    - Custom scalar types (UUID, Geography, JSONB, etc.)
    - Entity types (Address, Contact, Opportunity)
    - Zone system for geographic data
    - View system for configurable UI
  3. Authentication:
    - Email/password authentication
    - Social login with Google, Facebook, Amazon
    - JWT token generation and validation
    - User analytics tracking
  4. Google Zones Integration:
    - Service for interacting with Google Places API
    - Geographic zone management
    - PostGIS integration for spatial queries
  5. Database:
    - PostgreSQL with PostGIS schema
    - Migration scripts for schema and seed data
    - Entity relationships
    - JSONB for flexible data storage
  6. Documentation:
    - README with project overview and setup instructions
    - View system documentation
    - Debugging system documentation
    - Documentation standards
  7. Development Tools:
    - npm scripts for common tasks
    - Database management commands
    - TypeScript type checking
    - .gitignore for version control

  This foundation is ready for the next steps:
  1. Setting up your PostgreSQL database
  2. Running the migration scripts
  3. Implementing the remaining GraphQL resolvers as needed
  4. Adding the client-side React application
