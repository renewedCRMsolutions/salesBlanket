# SalesBlanket v3 Upgrade Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive upgrade plan for SalesBlanket v3, focused on implementing a centralized ServiceRegistry pattern with an advanced caching system. These improvements are designed to ensure optimal performance with high user volumes, efficiently manage polymorphic data from 75+ database tables, and provide better application lifecycle management.

## Core Components

The upgrade consists of three main components:

### 1. Service Registry

A centralized management system for all service singletons that provides:
- Controlled service initialization and shutdown
- Explicit dependency management
- Resource optimization
- Standardized service lifecycle

**Documentation:**
- [Overview](./service-registry/overview.md)
- [Implementation Plan](./service-registry/implementation-plan.md)
- [Migration Guide](./service-registry/migration-guide.md)

### 2. Cache System

An advanced caching architecture designed for polymorphic data with:
- Entity relationship-aware caching
- Optimized memory management
- Intelligent invalidation strategies
- Performance analytics

**Documentation:**
- [Overview](./cache-system/overview.md)
- [Entity Relationships](./cache-system/entity-relationships.md)

### 3. Application Lifecycle Management

Comprehensive application bootstrapping and monitoring:
- Controlled startup sequence
- Resource monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Shutdown coordination

**Documentation:**
- [Bootstrapping Process](./application-lifecycle/bootstrapping.md)
- [Performance Metrics](./application-lifecycle/performance-metrics.md)

## Implementation Timeline

The upgrade will be implemented in four phases:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement ServiceRegistry, BaseService and initializer
- Create CacheManager core functionality
- Update Main.js bootstrapping process
- Implement basic monitoring

### Phase 2: Service Migration (Weeks 3-4)
- Migrate core services (HttpService, DataService, etc.)
- Update service dependencies
- Implement lifecycle methods
- Basic cache integration

### Phase 3: Cache Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement entity relationship mapping
- Configure service-specific caching strategies
- Add cache analytics
- Optimize cache invalidation

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- Add detailed performance monitoring
- Implement lazy loading optimizations
- Create developer dashboard
- Fine-tune based on real usage metrics

## Benefits for High User Volumes

This upgrade provides significant benefits for applications with high user volumes:

1. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced API calls through intelligent caching
   - Optimized memory usage with controlled cache limits
   - Faster startup through dependency optimization
   - Better resource management

2. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - More efficient handling of polymorphic data
   - Better control over resource allocation
   - Improved application stability under load
   - Intelligent prefetching for predictable user flows

3. **Maintainability Upgrades**
   - Clearer service dependencies and relationships
   - Standardized service implementation patterns
   - Better debugging and monitoring tools
   - Comprehensive performance analytics

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this upgrade, SalesBlanket v3 will have:

1. A modern, maintainable service architecture
2. Optimized performance for high user volumes
3. Efficient management of complex, polymorphic data
4. Comprehensive monitoring and optimization tools
5. Clear patterns for future service development
