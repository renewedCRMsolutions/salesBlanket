# Google Integration Roadmap

1. Authentication Setup (First Priority)

Set up Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
Implement login flow to allow sales reps to connect their Google accounts
Create scopes for all required Google services (Contacts, Calendar, Drive, Maps, etc.)

2. Contact Synchronization

Create a bidirectional sync between your database contacts and Google Contacts
Design conflict resolution strategy for changes made in both systems
Implement regular sync jobs (delta sync rather than full sync for efficiency)

3. Location & Mapping Services

Integrate Google Maps API for:

Sales rep tracking
Territory/zone visualization
Pull address data by drawing polygon/zones on the map ang get all addresses to load into the database
Customer location mapping
Route optimization for sales visits



4. Document Management with Drive

Set up folder structure in Google Drive for each sales rep/territory
Create document indexing system to track customer-related documents
Implement metadata tagging system for easy search and retrieval

5. Calendar & Meeting Integration

Sync sales appointments with Google Calendar
Set up Google Meet integration for virtual meetings
Create automated reminders and follow-ups

6. AI & Productivity Tools

Integrate Google Gemini for AI-powered sales insights
Connect Google Tasks for sales rep task management
Implement Google Keep or Notebook for sales note taking

Implementation Plan
Let's start with the authentication and contact sync as you suggested:
Google Authentication Setup

Create Google Cloud Project:

Go to Google Cloud Console
Set up a new project for your application
Enable the necessary APIs (People API, Drive API, Maps, Calendar, etc.)


Configure OAuth Consent Screen:

Set up app information, scopes, and test users


Create OAuth Credentials:

Generate client ID and client secret
Set up authorized redirect URIs


Implement Auth Flow in Backend:

Create authentication endpoints
Handle token exchange and refresh
Store tokens securely in your database



Contact Synchronization Architecture
For Google Contacts sync, I recommend this approach:

Database Schema Additions:

Add google_contact_id to your contacts table
Create a contact_sync_log table to track sync history
Add last_synced_at timestamp to contacts


Sync Process:

Initial full sync when a user first connects
Periodic delta syncs based on modified timestamps
Conflict resolution based on last modified time or user preference


Field Mapping:

Map your database fields to Google Contacts fields
Handle special fields (e.g., custom fields, multiple phone numbers)
