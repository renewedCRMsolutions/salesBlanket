Now we have a basic login system set up! Let me explain what we've done:

  1. Authentication Setup:
    - Created a login page at /login.html
    - Implemented a GraphQL mutation for login
    - Added a dashboard page at /dashboard.html
    - Created auth-related endpoints
  2. Development Mode:
    - Added a hardcoded test user (mailto:admin@example.com / password123) for development
    - Set up the database connection to your AWS RDS instance
    - Added proper environment configuration
  3. Scripts:
    - Added start:aws script specifically for running on AWS
    - Added dev:watch script for development with auto-reload

  To test the login system, you can:

  1. Start the server:
  npm run dev
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/login.html
  3. Log in with the test credentials:
    - Email: mailto:admin@example.com
    - Password: password123
  4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard page

  This gives you a solid starting point for the authentication system. When you're ready to connect to your actual database, you can:

  1. Update the .env file with your actual AWS RDS password
  2. Run the database migration scripts to set up your schema
  3. Implement the full user management system
